# WIP: Rails Shotgun

Ruby on Rails application initialized with all the good stuff. Use at your own risk or we welcome pull requests. I will be working on a roadmap soon.

## Why is it named Shotgun??

> Shotgunning a beer is the simple act of consuming a beer at a high rate of speed.

The inspiration came from one of my common college activities. Rails Shotgun lets you be as productive as shotgunning a beer is at getting you drunk.

## Setup

Please take note that we are using `main` as the base branch.

### System dependencies

- Ruby version: 2.7.1
- Rails version: 6.0.3.1
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Redis installed

### Configuration

Make sure the app has been renamed before doing these steps.

#### Automated

```bash
bin/setup
```

#### Manually

````
Copy an existing sample environment file. Run:

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
````

and edit newly created `.env` file. The minimum you are going to need are
credentials to your local PostgreSQL database.

Then, install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
bundle install && yarn install
```

### Database creation

In order to create the database with all the necessary seed data, run:

```bash
rails db:create db:schema:load db:seed
```

### How to start the app

Start the Ruby on Rails server with:

```bash
rails server
```

We **highly** recommend running the weback dev server in another tab instead of inline compilation that will occur if you don't for speed.

```bash
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

To _optionally_ run Sidekiq, launch another process with:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Code quality checks

The application provides the following code quality analysis tools:

- [Brakeman][brakeman]
- [Fasterer][fasterer]
- [Rails Best Practices][rails-best-practices]
- [Bundler Audit][bundler-audit]

To run them locally:

```bash
$ bundle exec brakeman
$ bundle exec fasterer
$ bundle exec rails_best_practices
$ bundle audit
```
